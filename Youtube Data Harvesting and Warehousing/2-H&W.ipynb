He found it difficult to P and his inner bowl movements made the volcanoes quake. Then one day, he journeyed a Mount, where he saw a wise old man sitting on a dunny can. Hyaaayaaa said, &quot;I need to go now!&quot; The wise old man laughed and gave Hyaayaaa fifteen more minutes to wait.Suddenly all of Hyaaayaa&#39;s movements shoock the land, and from a distance people watched the mount flow brown streams and were shocked. <br><br>The gods must be angry! They thought. The mount has never flowed brown since 100 years ago. What has happened?<br><br>And to this day when people climb and feel constipated they can hear the sighs of Hyaaayaaaa calling in the wind!',\n",

So you should NOT just do 1 thing which is mindfulness but SHOULD incorporate other fold path on the way , this accumulating MERIT is how the LAW OF KARMA works on you towards the effectiveness of mindfulness and concentration.<br><br>One more thing about accumulating merits, while you&#39;re trying to accumulating merits by being the service to the world, you have to LET GO the idea that &quot; I have done this and that for the world&quot; which is also very hard part to do as well<br><br>You can think these 5,6 previous step is like the bottom of the pyramid, if your bottom is not solid ,then the top which is mindfulness and concentration is a hard struggling process',\n",

The guest king shouldn&#39;t be angry in that situation that&#39;s understandable but the king of the neighbouring country who you mentioned is wise, should not have served a soup like that. That&#39;s not how you treat a guest. When u give anything to anyone give something good not ruined.<br>2. The king who hosted , if he had patience the first thing he shud have done is replace the bowl and give a new bowl and say sorry. If he can handle having a fly in his soup then why didn&#39;t he have it himself instead of advising the guest. 😂 <br>U don&#39;t treat your guest in a bad way ( ex: Do you eat bad food then why give bad food to your guest) thats what I have been taught. <br><br>I totally understand the story was told to not get angry but the first story is not well put together bcoz it&#39;s the duty of the host King to apologise if he was actually a wisdomous person. He did a mistake and then he is advising the guest instead of apologising 😂. <br><br>If I gave the guest a food which had fly or bug or a hair by mistake i would immediately apologize I will not advice them to have patience and eat it.',\n",

       "   'comment_text': 'The true buddhistic faith advocates that you should construct your own personal extension to the religion because with a new age comes new challenges and you need new wisdom to put them down. You should extend the belief in such a way that when you go to sleep you smile like nothing ever bothered you. This is called shaping the truth so that it benefits you. One great example that brings men down in dispair in todays society is their inability to find a mating partner and that they struggle to keep up the pace. The important lesson men should know about is that a man should only be with a woman if he wants to raise a family, but he can only do so if the world is a safe place, but the world has never been safe for a child. So instead of wasting away in the poverty of keeping up to the expectation he has to question everything, look at the greater picture and not only look at the perspective of nature but to realise that reality is multi dimensional. Nature operates in a very low frequency and you can focuse your life purpose beyond that. Infact there are infinitely many layers of reality where the TRUTH looks different in different planes. When a man is facing hardship he should transform his sexual energy into spiritual by directing it to higher realities with the goal to find creative ways to improve his life. OM',\n",

These small small things used to bother me so much and I would react furiously. And they used to take advantage of it and the actual mistake gets erased. While my reaction becomes the biggest mistake. This happened for 20 years. And one day I started playing a deaf year to what ever they were saying. Internally it was hurting me. But I stood silent and listened. They were shocked and they even went to an extent of asking me why was I not reacting. Still I was not reacting.

       "   'comment_text': 'If you&#39;re trying to survive an abusive relationship with a significant other or an abusive family member or members, the less you can react to their provocations, the better your chances will be to position yourself favorably to either keep your abuser appeased enough for the time being to protect yourself and de-escalate a situation or to buy you more time to collect the resources you need to calmly leave and never look back.<br><br>There should be a survivor&#39;s guide for how to safely navigate abusive relationships for those of us who are trapped and can&#39;t leave yet.<br><br>If you need to stay and make the most out of an abusive situation it is important to stay calm and not rea t to their abuse by abusing them back because if they are providing you resources for your survival and you depend on them physically or financially in any capacity or rely on their expertise in an area you lack sufficiency in then you need to humble yourself and either teach yourself how to do all those things, earn enough money to pay a professional to help you, or you need to learn to put up with the abuser&#39;s offensive behavior in order to get whatever needs you need them to meet that is within their capacity to do for you and you do need to treat them like a tool since they are choosing to act like one.<br><br>You stay calm and centered even when they try to accuse you of acting childish and manipulative, trying to incite a defensive panick in you and baiting you to defend your character and integrity against their baseless claims. Because you have your own agenda. If you need housing and they have housing then you just think, &quot;I&#39;m only here for the free or cheap housing, I&#39;m only here for the shelter this tool is providing me, I am a good person who is just in a bad position and this is my best option right now so I&#39;m making due for now.&quot; While the abuser is screaming and raging at you for whatever asinine reason. <br><br>If your abuser is giving you money and helping you out with your bills then don&#39;t react to their abusive provocations, just remove yourself from the situation calmly, politely, and make up a legitimate sounding reason that will appease the abuser, &quot;I&#39;d love to stay and talk but I have to go to work, or I have to go start dinner for us, or I have to finish setting up the party, or I have to go put the kids in the car and finish getting every ready for the trip, etc, or I have to use the restroom excuse me for one moment.&quot;<br><br>If your abuser is screaming at you that you&#39;re not listening to them, look them calmly in the eyes in a friendly alert genuine way and keep your body language VERY relaxed and say, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m listening, I want to hear you out.&quot; Then they will be4ate you and demean you and reduce your self esteem to a puddle and call you every bad name in the book, and your job, if you are financially dependent on them and trapped for now, is to calmly nod along and agree with them, apologize for anything they want to blame you for even if they are completely wrong, placate their ego and tell them they are right, tell them you were wrong in this situation,that you were act childish (even if you were behaving like an adult and they were the one throwing a tantrum), and you just tell them what they want to hear. Then they will say, &quot;You&#39;re just telling me what I want to hear, aren&#39;t you?!&quot; They are testing you. Then you ssy, &quot;No, I genuinely agree with you and I see your point, and your point is valid. I was wrong about the situation and you were right, and I&#39;m genuinely sorry I behaved childishly. I appreciate your feedback because I know your heart is in the right place and I like knowing how I can improve myself for this relationship and to better my own life.&quot;<br><br>If they are determined to bait you further until you react, just so they can remove a privilege you were depending on receiving such as help with your bills or help with fixing your car or help with fill in the blank, then remain calm when they &quot;revoke&quot; your &quot;privilege&quot;. They will sa6, &quot;That&#39;s it! I was going to help you cover your expenses this month because u know how much you&#39;re struggling, but NOW I&#39;m not going to, because of how YOU are behaving!&quot; <br><br>You say, &quot;Okay, you&#39;re right, I&#39;m sorry, I deserved that. It is my loss.&quot;<br><br>They say, &quot;Exactly! Your loss!! Try to find somebody willing to stick their neck out for you like I would have!&quot;<br><br>You just nod and agree. Don&#39;t protest. You take the L.<br><br>Later on when the interaction ends and a new interaction with them begins, (like a scene change in a movie), your job is to act like ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS WRONG. The previous interaction NEVER HAPPENED. They may even try to bait you again, &quot;What&#39;s wrong? You seem upset about something...&quot; Your job is to respond calmly or happily, &quot;Nothing is wrong I&#39;m good, just a little tired.&quot;<br><br>The abuser will test further to get into another argument with you, &quot;You sure? Cuz you seem alittle off...&quot;<br><br>You remain stoic or happy and reply, &quot;Nope, I&#39;m all good, how are you?&quot;<br><br>Then you let them complain about whatever or rave about something they&#39;ve got going on that they are excited about. You&#39;re dying inside from the fight and lost privilege but you just grit your teeth and bare it. Act like everything is normal and you empathize with your abuser. Act like you enjoy their company and want to spend more time with them or more time doing what they want you to do, even if it makes your stomach turn to do so. Then your abuser, pleased with your performance of staying calm during the fight, appeasing their ego, and accepting the loss of privileges they took away to exercise their power and control and dominion over you, will randomly surprise you with something you don&#39;t want or need that doesn&#39;t help you in any reasonable way. But your job is to act ecstatic and grateful for their stupid gesture of &quot;love&quot;. They are again testing you to see if you react and go, &quot;What the hell is this?! This doesn&#39;t help me at all, I&#39;m about to lose my x, y, or z and you promised to help and now you give me a stupid fill in the blank?!&quot; But no, you act grateful and happy and mention nothing else.<br><br>Pleased with this, the abuser will finally &quot;restore&quot; the original privilege as you have &quot;passed&quot; their tests of allowing them to abuse you and blame you for their bad behavior while you act happy and neutral and pretend everything is fine and normal. <br><br>This is what they want. For you to passively accept their abuse. They want to talk to you like you are very stupid and don&#39;t know any better, and if you depend on them for help for the time being then yes, you must swallow your pride and act like you agree they are smarter and better than you in every way, even if it is nor the case. You must allow them to talk down to you if you want their help. <br><br>That is how transactional relationships with Narcissistic abusers work &quot;in your favor&quot;.<br><br>But acceot the narcissist&#39;s limitations. You must be okay with receiving what you can from them that they are willing to give.<br><br>If they will help pay your bills but don&#39;t want to speak to you in a loving way, don&#39;t hold them to that standard.<br><br>If you&#39;re dating a very attractive person who is an abuser, expect to put in all the work and not get upset when they cheat on your or cancel on you last minute. <br><br>Meet abusers whete they are at.<br><br>If the abuser is your parent and they will co-sign a loan to help you finish school in college but won&#39;t hug you or apologize for anything then you take the loan and act grateful and don&#39;t ask them for more. Don&#39;t ask from a narcissistic abuser that which they don&#39;t want to give to YOU. And don&#39;t complain to them that so and so gets fill in the blank while you only get fill in the blank privilege. The abuser gets to decide who they give what. If you get a roof over your head and food on the table but your sibling gets praise and hugs and is glorified and spoiled while you get scraps and leftovers then you take what you can get and you leave when you can and find another way to obtain your necessities providing it for yourself or finding other people who are willing to meet your needs for social or financial reciprocity.',\n",

Say Someone does something bad to you like they punch you and you respond with a harder punch and put an end to their abuse. It feel goods. Why should we not respond and then that very not responding makes us feel unvented and frustrated? Why do this when getting the reaction out feels satisfying? Can anyone advise? I have been trying this stoicism but it feels all bottled up and toxic to myself. Why let the others get away with the bad way they treat you when a reaction can often fix it?

Also sometimes when someone continuously upsets you and they are part of a group that you must be involved in, then its important to stand up to someone like that and sometimes you need all the anger you can conjure to do that and stop their behaviour. I think sometimes feeling angry and reacting is appropriate to deal with a situation. People often dont get it until they see a reaction. You can sit back and think about it and deal with it in a refined state but some people wont get it and wont stop until you stand up to them in a way that sends them a message.',\n",

       "   'comment_text': 'You cannot have self control on your own. It is a Fruit of the Holy Spirit. People if you were to die and do not believe and follow Jesus Christ of Nazareth your souls would go into hell. And if you are Catholic, Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, Mormon or Muslim, and any nonbeliever and died you would be in hell. The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). So Jesus endured the cross and died for our sins. “But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTqZEb-0tU0&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a>). Therefore if anyone in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things gave become new. 2 Corinthians 5:17.  New Jerusalem on earth- But there shall by no means enter it anything that defines or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.” “ The Son of God appeared to for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil”(1 John 3:8).<br><br>Do not take risks with your life.  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit Titus 3:5. God created the Earth and the Universes and the plants, animals and the birds and the sea mammals and fish. We were to reign over them but Adam sinned and sin then entered the world. The Devil usurped us a rulers of the animals and tries to usurp God’s reign and is the god of this age. He and his demons and us as humans is why there is evil in the world. Stop blaming God.  God sent His Son who was promised in Genesis and throughout the Bible to come to bring eternal life to those who repent of their sins and believe Jesus walked the Earth as fully human and as fully God, perfectly, healed and cast out evil spirits was scourged and nailed to a cross as a sacrifice to God to satisfy the need for a perfect sacrifice, placed in a tomb and three days after He died was resurrected. He was seen by His 12 apostles and then by 500 before He ascended to Heaven where He sits on the throne at God’s right hand.   <br>“When you were dead in your transgressions and the u circumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transmissions, having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. When He had disarmed the rulers and authorized, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him. Colossians 2:13-15. We were made with purposes that God gives you.  God as Creator made us not some big bang or as apes or evolution those are all made up I believe by the Devil and laughs at all who believe the lies. He wants us to get killed, destroy our lives and steal from us. The Devil know as the Serpent in the garden of Eden who convinced Eve and Adam to eat from the knowledge of good and evil is the evil who wants us to end up in hell. Revelation 20:11-15: Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.  And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books (books. These books record every thought Luke 8:17: For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, not anything hidden that will not be known and come to light. Romans 2:16: in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to the gospel. (words. Matthew 12:37: For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned. ) word, and deed (actions. Matthew 16:27: For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and will reward each according to his works.) of sinful men--all recorded by divine omniscience. (Will be compared to God’s perfect, holy standard Matthew 5:48: Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. 1 Peter 1:15, 16: but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.”) They will provide the evidence for eternal condemnation. and will be found wanting Romans 3:23: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, This also implies that there are degrees of punishment in hell Matthew 10:14, 15: And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city! Matthew 11:22: But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. Mark 12:38-40: Then He said to them in His teaching, “Beware of scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts, who devour widows’ houses, and for pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”  Luke 12:47, 48: And that servant who knew his master’s will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more. Hebrews 10:29: Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of Grace? were opened. And <br>another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. (Book of Life. It contains the names of the redeemed. Daniel 12:1 “At that time Michael shall stand up, The great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people; And there shall be a time of trouble, Such as never was since there was a nation, Even to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, Every one who is found written in the book.” )and the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And any one not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. <br>God is good. Believe Him and what the Bible says He said and did. If you do and do what it says do not follow what some person who does not believe or Satan and his demons lie to you about when you are awake or trying to sleep. Believe what God says about His Son Jesus you will have eternal life and will learn to Trust God not man or yourselves. Then when you die you will go to Heaven. There are no celebrities in Heaven they chose the lie of fame and fortune. Get the Study Bible App and read now from the Book of John. Then go get a good Bible like the John MacArthur Study Bible and call them 1-800-55-GRACE to find a good Bible teaching church. STAY AWAY FROM CHRISTIAN TV Broadcasters like TBN, DAYSTAR, WORD, SBN, CBN, etc. keep away from just any INTERNET AND CHRISTIAN BOOKS. Do not join a megachurch run by rich false teachers-pastors or not a teacher-pastor-run church led by doctrines of demons like Catholic churches. Pray today, repent by mourning over your sins(like not believing before and breaking the Ten Commandments) and give your life to Jesus. God warns us through tragedy to return to Him. Weather hot or flooding or tornadoes or high winds can all lead us to believe that God wants us to acknowledge Him as Creator and Provider and to let Him rule over us not the god of this age Satan who wants evil.',\n",

Learning to be happy in the moment is important. By wishing for happiness implies you are unhappy, and you can&#39;t have that which you can&#39;t obtain. Happiness is a state of mind, not a forced act or expectation. Relying on others for your own personal emotions robs them of their own emotions. 🙏❤',\n",

       "   'comment_text': 'Feelings are part of being human. I used to label some feelings as good or bad and avoided the &#39;bad&#39; --thinking that I was bad for having &#39;bad&#39; emotions. It was when I learned how to see them all as natural and neutral-neither good nor bad, just an emotion, that I was able to allow myself to experience ALL of them. <br><br>Experiencing an emotion is not the same as reacting from it. Power comes when we learn to recognize, name, and understand where the emotion is coming from and why. What just happened that triggered that emotion? Oftentimes we don&#39;t even know how to name an emotion so the frustration leads us to name it as anger, but underneath the anger if we&#39;re willing to look ...is the real emotions. Practice asking yourself, &quot;What else?&quot; several times when you are experiencing emotions. The more you can articulate the feelings you are feeling, the more you can understand yourself. The time spent being mindful gives you time to separate from the emotion, process it and DECIDE what to do next. <br><br>Give yourself permission to sit in an emotion or emotions, especially before quickly reacting. Reacting is often quick, but responding is after you&#39;ve had time to think. <br><br>The Bible has been very helpful for me to learn wisdom and see examples of how to handle all sorts of situations. <br><br>Two other insightful books: The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle<br><br>and Boundaries by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend',\n",

Seek the Lord the ONE true God in heaven. He sent His Son(Jesus Christ)over 2k yrs ago to die on a cross and shed ALL of His precious blood for YOU. For YOU to be reconciled back to God by BELIEVING in Him, putting your faith and trust in Him. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. He wants a RELATIONSHIP with you, nothing else. He will help you, call on His name and tell Him your heart. Leave your brokeness, worries, fears, faults, at His feet. Buddha is nothing more than a false prophet and is a false religion that will lead you down a  dead end road. Jesus is the ONLY way to heaven and the only road you need to travel.',\n",

       "   'comment_text': 'During my healing journey I realized that impulsive reactions come from triggers - from unhealed wounds.<br>For example, I got triggered very easily when people try to feel good about themselves at others expenses. In a work enviornment it would be comething like &quot;I dont want to put in the effort of doing things correctly and idc who that affects&quot;.<br>I then realized that my trigger came from childhood. There was a specific situation, where i was happily playing with my friends and my mother angrily pulled me away from then - when she realized that i was not happy about it, but sad that i couldn&#39;t play anymore, her anger turned towards me. She took me home to then madly ignore me the rest of the day. <br><br>As I healed the wounds, I was no longer blindly reacting. Rather, I found that I was able to more clearly descern why I was feeling bad about a situation. And then decided how to react to it. Sometimes this meant to let it go. Other times it meant to clearly and calmly call peoples behaviour out. <br><br>I guess thats what it really means to control emotions vs suppressing them... Suppressing is like grinding your teeth together and not letting big emotions show, while control comes from a position of inner peace.',\n",

Folks are lookin for their fathers and God in people and men. That&#39;s why they reward you when you don&#39;t react and put up with how they are. That&#39;s why politicians went all the time especially the crooked ones!!! Look of course you should learn the art of not reacting regardless if beneficial or not but if you get to that point or have to don&#39;t keep associating with such parties unless for money or gain at least in some kind of way.

       "   'comment_text': 'This teaching is useless when it comes to practice. In Sanskrit, Vasanas are the Karmic reactions of the mind that cause us to be frustrated and angry. How do I change the vasanas? If we have been causing these angry vasanas, for thousands of years, we will not control them with this common sense logic. Just by thinking, I will not be angry anymore does not allow us to not become angry any more. Just meditating will not permit us to do this either. I wasted 25 years of my life thinking this is how to control anger. There is a mind exercise in the Terevada Tradition for controlling angry Vasanas. We have to develop new vasanas of kindness and love. The Buddha called this exercise, Meeta. \\r<br>\\r<br>This involves wishing 7 things that all humans want for themselves.\\r<br>\\r<br>1, Physical beauty, \\r<br>2, Love, Health and Happiness.\\r<br>3, Success\\r<br>4, Wealth\\r<br>5, Fame\\r<br>6, Friendships\\r<br>7, and Enlightenment.\\r<br>\\r<br>By memorizing these 7 blessings recommended by the Buddha in various Buddhist Scriptures, and by practicing every day for over an hour each day, I was able to change these Vasanas. Finally when the angry vasanas arise, I killed them with the practice of Meeta. This took about 10 years. Now when anger arises , I kill it with the practice of Meeta instantly or almost instantly. \\r<br>\\r<br>Of course I wasted 25 years of my life with the common sense and reason you teach. What you teach is not what the Buddha taught in the Terevada tradition. What He taught is Meeta, which He called the easy to kill anger.',\n",

As your practice this, it softens your edges you feel more empathy and you are more likely not to be reacting to situations with anger. You can recognize the sensation of anger building so you quietly do breathing to regain emotional control. You are more balanced with not being too high or too low. You recognize that you are emotionally angry but you don&#39;t have to react with anger. Angry words don&#39;t create value in the world. Better to be silent with intentional foucus on breathing and awareness of your anger, thoughts can be witnessed with the same awareness as watching a storm pass by...',\n",

The biggest problem is always that other people don&#39;t feel that I take them seriously because I don&#39;t want to share their anger with something. Then I always have to wait until they have calmed down their injured ego and want to live peacefully next to me again. 🙂 💕☀️',\n",

You should extend the belief in such a way that when you go to sleep you smile like nothing ever bothered you. This is called shaping the truth so that it benefits you. One great example that brings men down in dispair in todays society is their inability to find a mating partner and that they struggle to keep up the pace. The important lesson men should know about is that a man should only be with a woman if he wants to raise a family, but he can only do so if the world is a safe place, but the world has never been safe for a child. So instead of wasting away in the poverty of keeping up to the expectation he has to question everything, look at the greater picture and not only look at the perspective of nature but to realise that reality is multi dimensional. Nature operates in a very low frequency and you can focuse your life purpose beyond that. Infact there are infinitely many layers of reality where the TRUTH looks different in different planes. When a man is facing hardship he should transform his sexual energy into spiritual by directing it to higher realities with the goal to find creative ways to improve his life.

Then they will say, &quot;You&#39;re just telling me what I want to hear, aren&#39;t you?!&quot; They are testing you. Then you ssy, &quot;No, I genuinely agree with you and I see your point, and your point is valid. I was wrong about the situation and you were right, and I&#39;m genuinely sorry I behaved childishly.

You seem upset about something...&quot; Your job is to respond calmly or happily, &quot;Nothing is wrong I&#39;m good, just a little tired.&quot;<br><br>The abuser will test further to get into another argument with you, &quot;You sure? Cuz you seem alittle off...&quot;<br><br>You remain stoic or happy and reply, &quot;Nope, I&#39;m all good, how are you?&quot;<br><br>Then you let them complain about whatever or rave about something they&#39;ve got going on that they are excited about.

Then your abuser, pleased with your performance of staying calm during the fight, appeasing their ego, and accepting the loss of privileges they took away to exercise their power and control and dominion over you, will randomly surprise you with something you don&#39;t want or need that doesn&#39;t help you in any reasonable way.

This doesn&#39;t help me at all, I&#39;m about to lose my x, y, or z and you promised to help and now you give me a stupid fill in the blank?!&quot; But no, you act grateful and happy and mention nothing else.<br><br>Pleased with this, the abuser will finally &quot;restore&quot; the original privilege as you have &quot;passed&quot; their tests of allowing them to abuse you and blame you for their bad behavior while you act happy and neutral and pretend everything is fine and normal. <br><br>This is what they want. For you to passively accept their abuse. They want to talk to you like you are very stupid and don&#39;t know any better, and if you depend on them for help for the time being then yes, you must swallow your pride and act like you agree they are smarter and better than you in every way, even if it is nor the case. You must allow them to talk down to you if you want their help. <br><br>That is how transactional relationships with Narcissistic abusers work &quot;in your favor&quot;.<br><br>But acceot the narcissist&#39;s limitations. You must be okay with receiving what you can from them that they are willing to give.<br><br>If they will help pay your bills but don&#39;t want to speak to you in a loving way, don&#39;t hold them to that standard.<br><br>If you&#39;re dating a very attractive person who is an abuser, expect to put in all the work and not get upset when they cheat on your or cancel on you last minute. <br><br>Meet abusers whete they are at.<br><br>If the abuser is your parent and they will co-sign a loan to help you finish school in college but won&#39;t hug you or apologize for anything then you take the loan and act grateful and don&#39;t ask them for more. Don&#39;t ask from a narcissistic abuser that which they don&#39;t want to give to YOU. And don&#39;t complain to them that so and so gets fill in the blank while you only get fill in the blank privilege. The abuser gets to decide who they give what. If you get a roof over your head and food on the table but your sibling gets praise and hugs and is glorified and spoiled while you get scraps and leftovers then you take what you can get and you leave when you can and find another way to obtain your necessities providing it for yourself or finding other people who are willing to meet your needs for social or financial reciprocity.', 0, '2023-07-11T23:44:25Z', 'R R'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'XTqZEb-0tU0', 'UgzHqdnWPLEw4rQvhi94AaABAg', 'very well explained, its best to see yourself where do u exist in this universe, and does useless arguments mean anything at all to this world, just my 2 cents...', 1, '2023-07-11T22:36:18Z', 'Rajdeep Mishra'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'XTqZEb-0tU0', 'Ugx5UFrIZvroMdXpU6d4AaABAg', 'Is this all AI generated?

So Jesus endured the cross and died for our sins. “But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTqZEb-0tU0&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a>). Therefore if anyone in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things gave become new. 2 Corinthians 5:17.

Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit Titus 3:5. God created the Earth and the Universes and the plants, animals and the birds and the sea mammals and fish. We were to reign over them but Adam sinned and sin then entered the world. The Devil usurped us a rulers of the animals and tries to usurp God’s reign and is the god of this age. He and his demons and us as humans is why there is evil in the world. Stop blaming God.  God sent His Son who was promised in Genesis and throughout the Bible to come to bring eternal life to those who repent of their sins and believe Jesus walked the Earth as fully human and as fully God, perfectly, healed and cast out evil spirits was scourged and nailed to a cross as a sacrifice to God to satisfy the need for a perfect sacrifice, placed in a tomb and three days after He died was resurrected. He was seen by His 12 apostles and then by 500 before He ascended to Heaven where He sits on the throne at God’s right hand.   <br>“When you were dead in your transgressions and the u circumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transmissions, having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. When He had disarmed the rulers and authorized, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him. Colossians 2:13-15. We were made with purposes that God gives you.  God as Creator made us not some big bang or as apes or evolution those are all made up I believe by the Devil and laughs at all who believe the lies. He wants us to get killed, destroy our lives and steal from us. The Devil know as the Serpent in the garden of Eden who convinced Eve and Adam to eat from the knowledge of good and evil is the evil who wants us to end up in hell. Revelation 20:11-15: Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.  And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books (books. These books record every thought Luke 8:17: For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, not anything hidden that will not be known and come to light. Romans 2:16: in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to the gospel. (words.

Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city! Matthew 11:22: But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. Mark 12:38-40: Then He said to them in His teaching, “Beware of scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts, who devour widows’ houses, and for pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”  Luke 12:47, 48: And that servant who knew his master’s will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more.

And <br>another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. (Book of Life. It contains the names of the redeemed. Daniel 12:1 “At that time Michael shall stand up, The great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people; And there shall be a time of trouble, Such as never was since there was a nation, Even to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, Every one who is found written in the book.” )and the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And any one not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. <br>God is good. Believe Him and what the Bible says He said and did. If you do and do what it says do not follow what some person who does not believe or Satan and his demons lie to you about when you are awake or trying to sleep. Believe what God says about His Son Jesus you will have eternal life and will learn to Trust God not man or yourselves. Then when you die you will go to Heaven. There are no celebrities in Heaven they chose the lie of fame and fortune. Get the Study Bible App and read now from the Book of John. Then go get a good Bible like the John MacArthur Study Bible and call them 1-800-55-GRACE to find a good Bible teaching church. STAY AWAY FROM CHRISTIAN TV Broadcasters like TBN, DAYSTAR, WORD, SBN, CBN, etc. keep away from just any INTERNET AND CHRISTIAN BOOKS. Do not join a megachurch run by rich false teachers-pastors or not a teacher-pastor-run church led by doctrines of demons like Catholic churches. Pray today, repent by mourning over your sins(like not believing before and breaking the Ten Commandments) and give your life to Jesus. God warns us through tragedy to return to Him.

It was when I learned how to see them all as natural and neutral-neither good nor bad, just an emotion, that I was able to allow myself to experience ALL of them. <br><br>Experiencing an emotion is not the same as reacting from it. Power comes when we learn to recognize, name, and understand where the emotion is coming from and why. What just happened that triggered that emotion? Oftentimes we don&#39;t even know how to name an emotion so the frustration leads us to name it as anger, but underneath the anger if we&#39;re willing to look ...is the real emotions. Practice asking yourself, &quot;What else?&quot; several times when you are experiencing emotions. The more you can articulate the feelings you are feeling, the more you can understand yourself. The time spent being mindful gives you time to separate from the emotion, process it and DECIDE what to do next. <br><br>Give yourself permission to sit in an emotion or emotions, especially before quickly reacting. Reacting is often quick, but responding is after you&#39;ve had time to think. <br><br>The Bible has been very helpful for me to learn wisdom and see examples of how to handle all sorts of situations. <br><br>Two other insightful books: The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle<br><br>and Boundaries by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend', 21, '2023-07-10T16:03:48Z', 'Be the LIGHT🕯️(Allison Tyrrell)'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'XTqZEb-0tU0', 'UgwR9-I7PkWluvau4yF4AaABAg', 'honestly..... once again someone takes a great story and ruins it with a narrative that he thinks is what the story is about.

Just by thinking, I will not be angry anymore does not allow us to not become angry any more. Just meditating will not permit us to do this either.

But as life keep on evolving people turned out into wise, selfish and greediness that the come become a saddest that never care whatever the result is, not only in our community but to the whole world as we connected to each other but not that word of love is contagious, if you do not force person to do so they won&#39;t do the same as other people do, if they are imitated by people who see them because they are no being punish or persecuted by the law or by disobeying the words of god or by the commandments then they will do the same, specially when they are making money by doing illegal like sex, vices, drugs and considering a thief not only by material things but also by opportunity  then they will do the things they wanted to do without any hassles .<br>Long ago I have a happy family life wasting a sperm never been an issue but by a wise and a li generations they wreck my family just to grab a wife unnotice that there&#39;s something going on we don&#39;t see . Untill they succeed on their plan to have my wife free to think it is crime on how and on why they achieved that kind of wrecking a happy family life . Thinking that at first the lady they do not like what&#39;s going on with them to think that they have a family or having a children to a separated woman it was hard to accept the fact that she was separated after having a wonderful life with three sons ,but in the long run when they are used to it they&#39;ll begin to like it specially when they are threaten or having a business plan that turned out into a criminal plan so they&#39;ll learn to pursue their work as an income no matter how or no matter what. Untill the victim couple get separated that affect the life of their children that involve the sad behavior of the family tree.<br>In creating a precious life instead of wasting the sperm it is the first choice of a man but who will be the lady or a girl wanted a situation of a man who never get an opportunity to work or make a business of its own. It&#39;s a lousy choice to a lady who never understand the man. Other thing the always have his own ideals on living a lady or girl to start a family life again and create a life of their own. But if the purpose is just making love and create a life without love it is an advantage to a man but also to a woman who wanted to have a child or sex only. Sad part of it at they time they are going to part the child will be longing to his father until they grow old and the same feeling to father.<br>Putting it on called incest, at first it is okay to the girl, making them a couple it will create a sad moment to man that longing for a real marriage or true love, but for the girl within a family tree not much issue not much on sadness if is truly or chosen to have a child of her own instead having it to other family, again sad part of it if the girl wanted to marry a man out of incest another struggle of a young girl who got child on a single status. <br>Advantage of an incest if they still believe on achieving something when the man is going to work abroad that lift a life who are dear to his heart and mind because of making love then it is an advantage to an incest instead lifting another family or families, but up to that moment only coz if it will pursue it forever as couple when  every time the vacation  may take it will not create a good behavior too, to the family as a whole. It&#39;s a human instinct to have malice behavior or attitude that lead to loneliness and solitaire.<br>In my case as man that never consider a men for one reason , Den is the first in mind for it is free of any responsibilities, it&#39;s a grand bachelor hungry for sex any one can be a partner at den without any harm but upon enjoying a life of den, party and sexual fantasy freely turn into a fubu the new nightmare in life  has just begun. Circumstances changes every now and then. how would you like to be a victim. But if anyone of us learn to understand that we all like or love sex or makin love for free then wasting a sperm it&#39;s not an issue . How would you like to sleep on a long time crush, long time friend, a night with your favorite teacher, a night at your neighbor without any doubt, worries, or hassles. But if the system is after doing so you push someone to do something he can not do or push somebody to go away after the sweetest desire it&#39;s also a lost to every one of us who struggle for sex every night we wanted to make love that lead us to a waste of sperm that we never chose to do so or a time that we are out of control instead raping anyone we can see at night which is a crime without any consent or permission to the acted person.<br><br>Ranak did his best, but he is also a man in need but no choice to do so because some of his friends turn their back on him and they leave him just a stub on his memories afterall doing the best he can as a good person.<br><br>The lady on buddahs spell, at first she also wanted morality, pride and dignity but fall for someone who&#39;s purpose is to lead a sect of their own out of her children or out of their family tree is an opportunist and a gambler that even the life of her own family put it on risk , that lost her morality, pride and dignity but win the price of being a rich and powerful woman in a barbaric way life that fall the nation into something unexplainable crisis.<br><br>Unknowingly Buddah is full of wisdom a command of having something or someone but also a command no or not having everything of any wishes but leaves you wisdom of no and yes, a do&#39;sand don&#39;t .

So does  and should every spirit emancipate in its path of Spirituality.', 1, '2023-07-01T16:58:53Z', 'Udaya k'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'UgxZ5sP8BVMMb2NvHs54AaABAg', 'This is not a Buddhist story.', 0, '2023-07-01T16:44:14Z', 'Sanuda Pilapitiya'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'Ugw8CqXCE0F_hrJVLNx4AaABAg', 'Enlightenment person like Buddha never say that words I think.<br>But Brahmacharya is the only for enlightenment but in proper way under Guru.', 3, '2023-07-01T16:38:47Z', 'EJOBNCAREER'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'UgzS0ZrHK1boqE7yhgt4AaABAg', 'Wonderful Advice...', 1, '2023-07-01T16:35:24Z', 'Mir Faruque'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'UgwIU-fzd6OnSyeyMJJ4AaABAg', 'Thanks ❤❤❤', 0, '2023-07-01T16:34:39Z', 'Aruna Rukman'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'UgzwCCyGKf_GTvz579p4AaABAg', '❤', 0, '2023-07-01T16:34:22Z', 'Aruna Rukman'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'UgydddwxnHz04U1Z48V4AaABAg', 'Who know about Buddha, know whether this story is true or fake', 1, '2023-07-01T16:32:55Z', 'Shiany Ong'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'Ugz6XXEbYJxQZMs9n8Z4AaABAg', 'Excellent', 1, '2023-07-01T16:24:49Z', 'Sudha Bachina'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', '9uRaRgPYZvY', 'UgzAKoFdSXJmv1ecbBl4AaABAg', 'Nonsene upside down Buddhism .

In other words, it’s the essence of all existence and non-existence – the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the actual creator of everything that exists now, ever existed in the past, or will exist in the future – right down to the minutest particles of dust – each being an individual ripple or wave. \\r<br>The big difference between chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a ‘middleman’ to connect us to our state of inner enlightenment, we’re able to do it ourselves. That’s because chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo allows us to tap directly into our enlightened state by way of this self-produced sound vibration. ‘Who or What Is God?’ If we compare the concept of God being a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to the teachings of Nichiren, it makes more sense to me that the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people perceive to be God, is the fantastic state of enlightenment that exists within each of us. Some say that God is an entity that’s beyond physical matter – I think that the vast amount of information continuously being conveyed via electromagnetic waves in today’s world gives us proof of how an invisible state of God could indeed exist. \\r<br>For example, it’s now widely known that specific data relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects – including an instant global awareness of something or a mass emotional reaction. It’s also common knowledge that these invisible waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars – none of which is possible without a receiver to decode the information that’s being transmitted. Without the receiver, the data would remain impotent. In a very similar way, we need to have our own ‘receiver’ switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our own life, all other life and what everything else in existence is. \\r<br>Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach the core of our enlightenment and keep it switched on. That’s because Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what scientists now refer to as the unified field of consciousnesses. To break it down – Myoho represents the Law of manifestation and latency (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. For example, the state of Myo is where everything in life that’s not obvious to us exists – including our stored memories when we’re not thinking about them – our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they’re dormant – our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma – and more importantly, our enlightenment. \\r<br>The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes evident to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory – whenever we experience or express our emotions – or whenever a good or bad cause manifests as an effect from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it merely means that it’s come out of the state of Myo (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It’s the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing. \\r<br>The second law – Renge – Ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect, governs and controls the functions of Myoho – these two laws of Myoho and Renge, not only function together simultaneously but also underlies all spiritual and physical existence. \\r<br>The final and third part of the tri-combination – Kyo, is the Law that allows Myoho to integrate with Renge – or vice versa. It’s the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects all Life and matter – as well as the past, present and future. It’s also sometimes termed the Universal Law of Communication – perhaps it could even be compared with the string theory that many scientists now suspect exists. \\r<br>Just as the cells in our body, our thoughts, feelings and everything else is continually fluctuating within us – all that exists in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux – constantly controlled by these three fundamental laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of Myo and ho in a single moment than it would ever be possible to calculate or describe. And it doesn’t matter how big or small, famous or trivial anything or anyone may appear to be, everything that’s ever existed in the past, exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of the Laws ‘Myoho-Renge-Kyo’ – the basis of the four fundamental forces, and if they didn’t function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. That’s because all forms of existence, including the seasons, day, night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation – rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two fundamental states of Myo and ho in absolute accordance with Renge – and by way of Kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn under the workings of what the combination ‘Myoho-Renge-Kyo’ represents. Nam, or Namu – which mean the same thing, are vibrational passwords or keys that allow us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with ‘Myoho-Renge-Kyo’. \\r<br>On a more personal level, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it’s the causes that we’ve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives – as well as the environment from moment to moment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is spinning, and chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo for a minimum of, let’s say, ten minutes daily to start with, any of us can experience actual proof of its positive effects in our lives – even if it only makes us feel good on the inside, there will be a definite positive effect. That’s because we’re able to pierce through the thickest layers of our karma and activate our inherent Buddha Nature (our enlightened state). By so doing, we’re then able to bring forth the wisdom and good fortune that we need to challenge, overcome and change our adverse circumstances – turn them into positive ones – or manifest and gain even greater fulfilment in our daily lives from our accumulated good karma. This also allows us to bring forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that’s preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we indeed are – regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexuality. We’re also able to see and understand our circumstances and the environment far more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations. As I’ve already mentioned, everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect – the ‘actual-proof-strength’ resulting from chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo always depends on our determination, sincerity and dedication. \\r<br>For example, the levels of difference could be compared to making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, producing a great song, and so on. Something else that’s very important to always respect and acknowledge is that the Law (or if you prefer God) is in everyone and everything. \\r<br>\\r<br>NB: There are frightening and disturbing sounds, and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It’s the emotional result of any noise or sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day, we are producing a sound vibration that’s the password to our true inner-self – this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things – such as your fears and desires etc. The best way to get the desired result when chanting is not to view things conventionally – rather than reaching out to an external source, we need to reach into our own lives and bring our needs and desires to fruition from within – including the good fortune and strength to achieve any help that we may need. Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo also reaches out externally and draws us towards, or draws towards us, what we need to make us happy from our environment. For example, it helps us to be in the right place at the right time – to make better choices and decisions and so forth. We need to think of it as a seed within us that we’re watering and bringing sunshine to for it to grow, blossom and bring forth fruit or flowers. It’s also important to understand that everything we need in life, including the answer to every question and the potential to achieve every dream, already exists within us.', 2, '2023-07-15T12:53:24Z', 'tyamada21'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'sf3J9MRRiEs', 'UgyRbRQ-4T0AsUfGsdB4AaABAg', 'Very good story to learn more positively. ❤', 1, '2023-07-14T13:06:34Z', 'Afrouz Khakpour'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'sf3J9MRRiEs', 'Ugx9x57dSoa0VBfvlKB4AaABAg', 'Positive thoughts are what pull you so much trouble.

Do you long for a way to break free and live a more positive, fulfilling life? It&#39;s time to take charge and put an end to those self-defeating thoughts once and for all. Here&#39;s how you can stop negative thoughts and reclaim control over your mind:<br><br>1⃣ Recognize the Power of Awareness: The first step in overcoming negative thoughts is to become aware of them. Pay attention to your thinking patterns and identify the negative thoughts that creep into your mind. By acknowledging them, you can start to challenge and change them.<br><br>2⃣ Challenge Your Thoughts: Negative thoughts often stem from irrational or distorted thinking. Question the validity of your negative beliefs and seek evidence to support or refute them. Replace negative thoughts with positive and realistic ones. Embrace a mindset that empowers and uplifts you.<br><br>3⃣ Practice Gratitude: Cultivate an attitude of gratitude. Focus on the positive aspects of your life and acknowledge the things you are grateful for. Gratitude helps shift your perspective and counterbalances negative thinking.<br><br>4⃣ Surround Yourself with Positivity: Surrounding yourself with positive influences can have a profound impact on your thoughts and emotions. Seek out supportive friends, engage in activities that bring you joy, and expose yourself to uplifting content like books, podcasts, or motivational speeches.<br><br>5⃣ Embrace Self-Care: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that nourish your soul, such as exercising, meditating, journaling, or spending time in nature. Prioritize self-care to reduce stress and enhance your overall mental resilience.<br><br>6⃣ Practice Mindfulness: Be present in the moment and observe your thoughts without judgment. Mindfulness allows you to detach from negative thinking and develop a greater sense of self-awareness. It enables you to respond to negative thoughts in a calm and constructive manner.<br><br>7⃣ Seek Professional Help if Needed: If negative thoughts persist and significantly impact your daily life, don&#39;t hesitate to seek professional support. A therapist or counselor can provide valuable guidance and strategies tailored to your specific needs.<br><br>Remember, overcoming negative thoughts is a journey that requires persistence and self-compassion. You have the power to transform your mindset and create a more positive and fulfilling life. Start today, take that first step, and embrace the joy that awaits you on the other side.<br><br>🌈 Let go of negativity, embrace positivity, and embark on a life filled with happiness and abundance! 🌟', 0, '2023-05-10T18:01:42Z', 'Break Limits Motivation'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'T0fVP91fiLc', 'UgzLXfoc3BLj6q-DQet4AaABAg', 'Amen ❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏', 1, '2023-04-20T07:34:14Z', 'jean Ditsos Ditsos'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'T0fVP91fiLc', 'UgxRF2vIzZhzeMHsuV54AaABAg', 'Thank you for sharing this useful story 🙏🏿', 1, '2023-04-18T14:32:15Z', 'sebar'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgxV2VnRqy8qD-9B87J4AaABAg', 'Inspirational ,thank you🙏', 2, '2023-08-06T13:39:12Z', 'Real kabro'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgwcBmVWh7nseHHHrep4AaABAg', 'Bro ai voice website ka naam bata do please', 0, '2023-07-28T02:19:40Z', 'Jagdish Banjara'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgxW8Lyw5UCYkjZS8q14AaABAg', 'But, how to control anger when someone is intentionally disturbing you?', 0, '2023-07-26T01:48:53Z', 'Mr.SID Patil'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgzBvM7AzhwUBz7Ushl4AaABAg', 'Is it okay to have some degree of anger if we can control it🤔unintelligent and rude ppl usually are only able to get the right messages by showing them some anger…', 1, '2023-07-22T20:48:03Z', 'Recuerdos'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgzccF3nGxUx_wCh1YJ4AaABAg', 'What is the background  music name.?', 0, '2023-07-22T17:49:19Z', 'Dark Creator'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgwXd9sZIFjwX9hcFYl4AaABAg', 'Absolute motivation', 0, '2023-07-20T10:37:00Z', 'Manisha Mahar'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgweCEJKPsqcT9dVBf14AaABAg', 'when anger comes shaitaan is with you.', 2, '2023-07-20T05:46:58Z', 'Esah G'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'Ugz_elw-l-cXZgNhbBJ4AaABAg', 'I agree with the video only about 80% because there are times you MUST<br>show anger and hostility to defend and protect yourself', 3, '2023-07-20T05:21:27Z', 'szvqorwnpst ahskypfwmp'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'Ugwi7EbaSZe7gkH6V3p4AaABAg', 'It always involves a small village and a Zen master', 2, '2023-07-20T04:50:23Z', 'T Bjornsson'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'UgxnPKazAuimL5mpeBd4AaABAg', 'Amazing', 0, '2023-07-20T04:39:12Z', 'Jitendra Singh Balesar'), ('UCSTkDAzusiM1dumQ-znMtsw', 'ul1BUO3LBiY', 'Ugz_DW454nEBDH-DL2V4AaABAg', 'Good content.
